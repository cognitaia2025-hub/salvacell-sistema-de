# Dashboard Metrics Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the comprehensive dashboard metrics that are crucial for the performance assessment and monitoring of the system. The metrics will provide visibility into user engagement, system performance, and key operational indicators.

## Objectives
- To define key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with business goals.
- To implement tracking for user interactions and system performance metrics.
- To create a dashboard for real-time monitoring and reporting.

## Scope
This plan covers:
- Identification of KPIs.
- Data collection methods.
- Tools and technologies for dashboard implementation.
- Roles and responsibilities.
- Timeline for implementation.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. User Engagement Metrics
   - Daily Active Users (DAU)
   - Monthly Active Users (MAU)
   - User Retention Rate

2. System Performance Metrics
   - Average Response Time
   - System Uptime
   - Error Rates

3. Operational Metrics
   - Revenue Metrics
   - Cost per Acquisition (CPA)
   - Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

## Data Collection Methods
- Use of analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel).
- Custom logging for system performance metrics.
- User feedback surveys for CSAT scores.

## Tools and Technologies
- Dashboard Framework: Grafana / Tableau
- Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask)
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Project Manager: Oversees implementation and timeline.
- Data Analyst: Defines metrics and analyzes data.
- Developer: Implements tracking and dashboard.

## Timeline
- Project Kickoff: January 18, 2026
- KPI Definition: January 25, 2026
- Development Phase: January 26 - March 26, 2026
- Testing Phase: March 27 - April 10, 2026
- Go Live: April 15, 2026

## Conclusion
A comprehensive dashboard metrics implementation plan is critical for understanding user behavior, system performance, and driving business decisions. This plan will guide the team through the implementation process, ensuring that all aspects are covered and tracked effectively.
